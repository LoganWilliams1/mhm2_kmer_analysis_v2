# MetaHipMer2 - MHM2 #

[MetaHipMer (*MHM*)](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome/downloads?authuser=0) is a *de novo* metagenome short-read assembler. This is version 2 (MHM2), which is written entirely in
[UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov), CUDA and HIP, and runs efficiently on both single servers and on multinode supercomputers, where it can scale up to
coassemble terabase-sized metagenomes. More information about MetaHipMer can be found under the [ExaBiome Project](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome) 
of the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org) and in several publications:

The quality of MetaHipMer assemblies is comparable with other leading metagenome assemblers, as documented in the results of the CAMI2 competition, where MetaHipMer was rated first for quality in two out of three datasets, and second in the third dataset:

Information about building, installing and running MHM2 can be found in the [user guide](docs/mhm_guide.md)

MHM2 is developed and maintained by the [Exabiome Project](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/exabiome/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and is supported by the [Exascale Computing Project](https://www.exascaleproject.org) (17-SC-20-SC), a collaborative effort of the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science and the National Nuclear Security Administration.
