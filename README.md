# MHM2 #

MetaHipMer (*MHM*) is a *de novo* metagenome short-read assembler. This is version 2 (MHM2), which is written entirely in
[UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov) and runs efficiently on both single servers and on multinode supercomputers, where it can scale up to
coassemble terabase-sized metagenomes. More information about MetaHipMer can be found in:
